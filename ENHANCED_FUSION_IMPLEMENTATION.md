# Enhanced SMC Fusion Core Implementation

## Overview

The Enhanced SMC Fusion Core has been successfully implemented and integrated into the ARIA system. This implementation combines the original SMC (Smart Money Concepts) analysis with a secret ingredient meta-weighting AI system that provides institutional-grade signal fusion capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. **Secret Ingredient Meta-Weighting AI**
- **Online Linear Fusion (SGD)**: Lightweight online learning model that adapts weights based on realized returns
- **Multi-Model Signal Fusion**: Combines signals from LSTM, CNN, PPO, Visual AI, and LLM Macro models
- **Regime Detection**: Automatically detects market regimes (trend, highvol, lowvol, neutral) and adjusts strategy
- **Anomaly Gating**: Prevents trades during anomalous market conditions using robust z-score detection

### 2. **Enhanced Risk Management**
- **ATR-Based Sizing**: Dynamic position sizing based on Average True Range
- **Capped Kelly Criterion**: Limits position size to prevent overexposure
- **Daily Drawdown Protection**: Automatic risk reduction when approaching daily limits
- **Kill-Switch Mechanism**: Emergency stop functionality for risk control

### 3. **Market Context Integration**
- **Volatility Smoothing**: EWMA-based volatility normalization
- **Spread Analysis**: Real-time spread monitoring and adjustment
- **Liquidity Awareness**: Session and liquidity factor integration
- **Regime-Aware Shaping**: Adjusts signal strength based on market conditions

### 4. **State Persistence & Audit**
- **Automatic State Saving**: Persists model weights and market context
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Logs all decisions, weights, and market conditions
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks wins, losses, and daily PnL

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **EnhancedSMCFusionCore**: Main fusion engine that combines SMC analysis with AI signals
2. **OnlineFusionSGD**: Lightweight online learning model for meta-weighting
3. **MarketContext**: Tracks market regime, volatility, and spread information
4. **EnhancedTradeIdea**: Enhanced trade idea with meta-weights and regime information
5. **FeedbackService**: Handles trade outcomes and updates model weights

### Integration Points

- **Edge Engine**: Updated to use enhanced fusion core with backward compatibility
- **Signal Generator**: Enhanced to provide AI signals and market features
- **Feedback Loop**: Complete feedback system for online learning

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enhanced Fusion Core
ARIA_ENABLE_ENHANCED_FUSION=1
ARIA_RISK_PER_TRADE=0.005          # 0.5% risk per trade
ARIA_MAX_DD=0.03                   # 3% max daily drawdown
ARIA_KELLY_CAP=0.25                # 25% cap on Kelly criterion
ARIA_ANOMALY_Z=3.2                 # Anomaly detection threshold
ARIA_SGD_LR=0.01                   # Learning rate for meta-model
ARIA_SGD_L2=0.0005                 # L2 regularization

# Execution Control
ARIA_ENABLE_EXEC=0                 # Set to 1 for live execution
ARIA_ENABLE_MT5=0                  # Set to 1 for MT5 integration
ARIA_MAX_SLIPPAGE_PIPS=1.5         # Maximum slippage tolerance
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from backend.smc.smc_fusion_core import get_enhanced_engine

# Create enhanced engine
engine = get_enhanced_engine("EURUSD")

# Process bar with AI signals
raw_signals = {
    "lstm": 0.3,
    "cnn": 0.2,
    "ppo": -0.1,
    "vision": 0.4,
    "llm_macro": 0.15
}

market_feats = {
    "price": 1.1005,
    "spread": 0.00008,
    "atr": 0.0012,
    "trend_strength": 0.35,
    "liquidity": 0.7,
    "session_factor": 0.8
}

# Generate enhanced trade idea
idea = engine.ingest_bar(bar, raw_signals, market_feats)
```

### Feedback Integration

```python
from backend.services.feedback_service import feedback_service

# Submit trade outcome
feedback_service.submit_trade_feedback("EURUSD", 0.05, last_features)

# Get engine statistics
stats = feedback_service.get_engine_stats("EURUSD")
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:

```bash
cd ARIA_PRO
python test_enhanced_fusion.py
```

## Migration from Old System

The enhanced fusion core is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the old SMC fusion core:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The `get_engine()` function now returns the enhanced engine
2. **Gradual Migration**: Systems can be updated incrementally
3. **Feature Toggle**: Use `use_enhanced=False` in EdgeEngine for old behavior

## Benefits

### 1. **Institutional-Grade Signal Fusion**
- Combines multiple AI models with market context
- Adapts to changing market conditions
- Prevents overfitting through online learning

### 2. **Risk Management**
- Dynamic position sizing based on volatility
- Automatic risk reduction in adverse conditions
- Emergency stop mechanisms

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Lightweight implementation with minimal dependencies
- Efficient online learning without heavy retraining
- Real-time adaptation to market changes

### 4. **Audit & Compliance**
- Complete decision audit trail
- State persistence for regulatory compliance
- Performance tracking and reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Live Testing**: Test with real market data in a controlled environment
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters based on live performance
3. **Additional Models**: Integrate more AI models as they become available
4. **Advanced Features**: Add portfolio-level risk management and correlation analysis
