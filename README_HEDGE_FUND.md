# 🏛️ ARIA Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund System

## Complete T470-Optimized Institutional Trading Platform

### System Overview

ARIA has been transformed into a **multi-strategy hedge fund brain** running entirely on CPU with institutional-grade analytics, optimized specifically for the Lenovo T470 (i5-7300U, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD).

### 🎯 Core Features

#### **Multi-Strategy Model Arsenal**
- **Sequence Models**: LSTM, MiniTransformer
- **Pattern Recognition**: CNN, TinyAutoencoder  
- **Tabular Learning**: XGBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost_Enhanced
- **Policy Models**: PPO, MicroRL
- **Probabilistic**: BayesianLite

#### **Institutional Analytics**
- Real-time portfolio performance metrics
- Strategy attribution and model contributions
- Risk analytics (VaR, Expected Shortfall, Drawdown)
- Regime performance analysis (Trend/Range/Breakout)
- Live P&L tracking and Sharpe ratio calculation

#### **T470 Optimization**
- **Memory Footprint**: ~33MB total for 8-model ensemble
