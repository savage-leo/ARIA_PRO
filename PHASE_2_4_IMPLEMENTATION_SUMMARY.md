launch ront backend ensure everything is set for production and listand identify areas of implementation and implement you can also reference the web and Next steps you might want to consider:
Set ARIA_ENABLE_MT5=1 in your environment to connect to live MT5 data
Set ARIA_ENABLE_EXEC=1 to enable actual trade execution (currently in dry-run mode)
Add more symbols via ARIA_SYMBOLS="EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY"
Monitor the system performance and adjust risk parameters as needed
